**Simple allocation with correlated types**
<!-- **[Simple allocation with correlated types](http://jpreusser.github.io/files/simple_allocation_july_2022.pdf)** -->

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A principal allocates a single indivisible object to one of $n$ agents who all want it.
    The agents have private information that is valuable to the principal.
    In particular, each agent may have information about the principal's payoff from allocating to the others.
    Without using monetary transfers, the principal designs a dominant-strategy IC mechanism.
    Our main results make a case for *jury mechanisms*.
    Such a mechanism splits the agents into a set of jurors and a set of candidates.
    The jury decides which of the candidates wins the object. Jury mechanisms are optimal within a restricted set of mechanisms, and approximately optimal in symmetric environments with many agents.
    In general, exactly-optimal DIC mechanisms may require the principal to commit to random allocations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A principal must decide between two options. Which one she prefers depends on the private information of two agents. One agent always prefers the first option; the other always prefers the second. Transfers are infeasible. One application of this setting is the efficient division of a fixed budget between two competing departments. We first characterize all implementable mechanisms under arbitrary correlation. Second, we study when there exists a mechanism that yields the principal a higher payoff than she could receive by choosing the ex-ante optimal decision without consulting the agents. In the budget example, such a profitable mechanism exists if and only if the information of one department is also relevant for the expected returns of the other department. We generalize this insight to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a profitable mechanism in the $n$-agent allocation problem with independent types.
