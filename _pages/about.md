Hi!
I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Bonn.
My main research interests are in microeconomic theory, with a focus on allocation problems without money.

You can reach me at <firstname.lastname@uni-bonn.de>.

You can find my CV [here](http://jpreusser.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

[Simple allocation with correlated types](http://jpreusser.github.io/files/simple_allocation.pdf)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A single indivisible object is to be allocated to a group of agents who all desire the object.
    The efficient allocation depends on the private information of the agents.
    In particular, each agent may have information about the value of allocating to the others.
    Monetary transfers are unavailable.
    We study optimal dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DIC) mechanisms.
    Our main results make a case for *jury mechanisms*.
    A jury mechanism splits the agents into a set of jurors and a set of candidates.
    The jury decides which of the candidates wins the object; jury members never win the object.
    Jury mechanisms are optimal when there are three or fewer agents, approximately optimal in symmetric environments with many agents, and the only deterministic DIC mechanisms satisfying an anonymity axiom.
    Exactly optimal DIC mechanisms may require commitment to random allocations.
    We fully characterize when all extreme points of the set of DIC mechanisms are deterministic.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A principal must decide between two options. Which one she prefers depends on the private information of two agents. One agent always prefers the first option; the other always prefers the second. Transfers are infeasible. One application of this setting is the efficient division of a fixed budget between two competing departments. We first characterize all implementable mechanisms under arbitrary correlation. Second, we study when there exists a mechanism that yields the principal a higher payoff than she could receive by choosing the ex-ante optimal decision without consulting the agents. In the budget example, such a profitable mechanism exists if and only if the information of one department is also relevant for the expected returns of the other department. We generalize this insight to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a profitable mechanism in the $n$-agent allocation problem with independent types.
